# dpll
Implementation of DPLL Algorithm in python

DPLL algorithm is a boolean satisfiablity solver that takes a <br />
set of variables and connectives in CNF and returns either a satisfying <br />
assignment that would make the CNF sentence true or determines that no <br />
satisfying assignment is possible. <br />

Command: <br />
python DPLL.py -i CNF_sentences
